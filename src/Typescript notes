// derived classed = subclasses, base classes = super classes. super() is required for any derived class that has a constructor, and calls the constructor of the base class. 

// instead of @description for an object, we have this.description and instead of initialize we have constructor(decription: string) but also have to declare that description exists and it's datatype before making constructor. Also when its a subclass you use {super(description)} instead of declaring the existence of the attributes for the class and also declaring thier datatype.

// pretty sure the = 0 is the default

class Animal {
    name: string;
    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
    }
}

class Snake extends Animal {
    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }
    move(distanceInMeters = 5) {
        console.log("Slithering...");
        super.move(distanceInMeters);
    }
}
